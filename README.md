# üòµ‚Äçüí´ Balancing act

TLDR: interactive art piece about everyday things that stress us (students) out.  I built this for [DESINV 23](https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2025-spring-desinv-23-1-lec-1), a class on creative programming & electronics at UC Berkeley.

Submit an emoji representing what you are stressed about [here](https://airtable.com/appILZk0gunMZ1J1i/pagYvgyAensDCj8mv/form).

## Showcase / description of finished piece

As students, we've got a lot going on in our lives and that can be difficult to manage / balance. Sometimes I feel like I'm going to explode! Each "emoji bubble" represents something that causes a viewer stress. As time progresses, more bubbles spawn on the canvas. They begin to fall and the viewers can attempt to hit the bubbles and push them away (represents completing a task). However, over time, the bubbles become too much too handle for the viewers.

## The process

This piece started as an attempt to depict the busy world we live in but through silhouettes (inspired by [Apple's iPod advertisements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod_advertising#Silhouette_style)).
